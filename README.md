Electron is in charge of watching if a new file is added to the `FHIR` directory.  
The "directory watcher" and the "file getter" are in public/electron.js (aka main.js).

- npm run desktop-dev to launch Electron in dev mode.
- npm run desktop-exe to launch the build of the Electron executable in the dist folder. Double click on it to install on Windows
